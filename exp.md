## Core Technology Stack

The application is built on **FastAPI**, a modern Python web framework that provides automatic API documentation, request validation, and high performance through async/await patterns. The translation engine leverages **Ollama**, an open-source framework for running large language models locally, specifically using the **Mistral model** for translation tasks. Language detection is handled by the **langdetect** library, which provides statistical language identification without requiring external services.

## Translation Pipeline and Processing Flow

The translation process begins with request validation using **Pydantic models**, ensuring type safety and data integrity. When a translation request is received, the system first determines the source language - either from the user-provided parameter or through automatic detection using langdetect. The language detection process maps ISO language codes to full language names through a comprehensive mapping dictionary covering 100+ languages.

If the source and target languages are identical, the system immediately returns the original text with a confidence score of 1.0. Otherwise, it proceeds to check Ollama service availability by making a health check request to the Ollama API endpoint. The system creates a structured prompt for the Mistral model, specifying the translation task with parameters optimized for consistency (temperature: 0.1, top_p: 0.9, max_tokens: 500).

oken Guidelines by Use Case
Here's a comprehensive guide for different translation needs:
Use Case	Characters	Tokens	Description
Short phrases	100-500	100-150	Greetings, simple sentences
Paragraphs	500-1500	150-400	Medium-length content
Long paragraphs	1500-3000	400-800	Articles, documents
Full documents	3000+	800-1500	Long articles, reports
Performance Considerations
With 800 tokens:
Response time: 2-8 seconds (vs 1-5 seconds with 500)
Memory usage: Slightly higher but manageable
Quality: Better for longer translations
With 1000+ tokens:
Response time: 3-12 seconds
Memory usage: Higher
Quality: Best for very long content

## Fallback System and Error Handling

The application implements a robust fallback mechanism to ensure service availability even when the Ollama service is unavailable. The fallback system maintains a dictionary of common phrases (hello, thank you, goodbye) translated into 11 major languages, providing basic translation capabilities with reduced confidence scores (0.1-0.3). This design ensures the API remains functional for basic use cases while clearly indicating when fallback translations are being used.

Error handling follows a hierarchical approach: request validation errors return HTTP 422 status codes, Ollama service unavailability triggers HTTP 503 responses, and translation failures result in HTTP 500 errors. The system includes comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring, with structured error messages that help identify the root cause of issues.

## API Design and Endpoints

The RESTful API exposes five primary endpoints: a health check endpoint (`GET /health`) for service monitoring, a translation endpoint (`POST /translate`) for the core functionality, a language detection endpoint (`POST /detect-language`) for standalone language identification, a supported languages endpoint (`GET /supported-languages`) for client discovery, and an Ollama status endpoint (`GET /ollama-status`) for service health monitoring.

The API implements **CORS middleware** to support cross-origin requests from web applications, making it suitable for integration into frontend applications. Response formatting follows a consistent JSON schema that includes the original text, translated text, detected language, confidence scores, and status messages, providing clients with comprehensive information about the translation process.

## Performance Characteristics and Optimization

The system is designed for moderate throughput with translation requests typically taking 1-5 seconds to complete, depending on text length and Ollama model performance. Memory usage is approximately 4GB RAM when running the Mistral model, making it suitable for deployment on standard development machines or small servers. The application can handle concurrent requests limited by Ollama's processing capacity, with language detection operations completing in under 50ms and fallback translations responding in under 100ms.

Performance optimization is achieved through several mechanisms: the use of async/await patterns in FastAPI for non-blocking I/O, connection pooling for Ollama API calls, and efficient language code mapping through dictionary lookups. The system also implements request timeout handling (30 seconds for Ollama calls) to prevent hanging requests and ensure responsive error handling.

## Security and Privacy Features

Security is built into the system's architecture through its offline-first design. All data processing occurs locally without any external API calls, ensuring complete data privacy and eliminating the risk of data exposure to third-party services. The system requires no API keys or authentication tokens, reducing the attack surface and simplifying deployment.

The application implements input validation through Pydantic models, preventing injection attacks and ensuring data integrity. CORS configuration allows controlled cross-origin access while maintaining security boundaries. The system does not store or log translation data, providing additional privacy protection and reducing storage requirements.

## Deployment and Configuration

The application is designed for easy deployment with minimal external dependencies. The only external requirement is Ollama with the Mistral model, which can be installed through a simple shell script. The Python dependencies are managed through a requirements.txt file, and the application includes a startup script that automatically checks for required packages and Ollama availability.

Configuration is centralized in the main application file, allowing easy modification of Ollama service URLs, model selection, and translation parameters. The system supports different Ollama models (Llama, CodeLlama, etc.) by simply changing the model parameter, providing flexibility for different use cases and performance requirements. The application runs on port 8000 by default but can be easily configured for different ports or deployment environments.
